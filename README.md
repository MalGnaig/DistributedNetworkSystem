# DistributedNetworkSystem
This project was done offline on a local repository that is why there are very few commits.

The distributed file storage system is made to allow multiple users storing/deleting/accessing... files (in accordance with concurrent access). The files once stored will be organised accordingly and copies being made to different storage units to prevent loss of files if there are corruptions.
